Guidance-2025 Special

Theme: Roadmap for Coding Placement Preparation in 2025
Target Audience: Beginners and Experienced Candidates
 Focus: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Consistency, and Success in Placements
 Motivational Quote:
"You have a whole new year to restart, refocus, reorganize, get back on track and correct the mistakes you did in 2024. It's a new opportunity. Don't waste it. ... It is never too late..."
"Most people who doubt you; doubt you because they can never see themselves doing what you are trying to do."

Roadmap for Beginners
Step 1: Identify Core DSA Topics
Arrays: Basics, Search, Sorting
Strings: Basics, Substrings, Palindromes, Pattern Matching
Stack/Queue/Deque: Basics, Implementations, Problems
Linked List: Implement, Traversal, Insert, Delete, Reversal, Cycles
HashMap/Set: Basics, Usage, Time & Space
Priority Queue/Heap: Concepts, Implementation, Time & Space, Usage
Recursion: Concepts, Leap of Faith, Base Case, Writing like a Story (18 videos)
Tree: Binary Tree, BST, Properties, Traversals, Height, Depth, BFS, DFS
Trie/Prefix Trees: Insert, Delete, Search
Graph: One-stop solution - "Graph Concepts & Questions" Playlist
Dynamic Programming (DP): One-stop solution - "DP Concepts & Questions" Playlist
Segment Tree: Concepts & Questions
Sliding Window: Implementation, Usage, Time & Space
Greedy Algorithms: Medium/Easy Questions
Backtracking: How to, Time & Space, Usage
Line Sweep Algorithm: Application, Usage
Monotonic Structures: Stack, Queue, Deque
Cumulative Sum/Prefix Sum: Application, Usage
Bit Manipulation: Concepts and Applications
Mathematics: Lifetime Skill
Step 2: Study Concepts One by One
Pick one topic at a time.
Fix a number of days for each topic.
Study topic concepts and implementations.
Solve questions:
10 Easy
20 Medium
10 Hard (Focus on famous interview questions initially)
Focus on commonly asked interview questions that involve core topic usage.
Repeat for other topics.
Step 3: Identify Patterns in Problems
Observe patterns like fixed/variable length subarrays or substrings and use techniques like Sliding Window.
Recognize if recursion or DP applies.
The author plans to create a separate video on "identifying topics from questions."
Step 4: Test with Contests
Participate in coding contests after covering topics roughly.
If unable to solve questions:
Identify why.
Determine which topic/type was involved.
If a new topic, study. If old, revise.
Explore approaches:
Leetcode Discussion
YouTube (Post-mortems of tough questions)

Roadmap for Experienced Candidates
Focus Areas
Advanced Topics:
Dynamic Programming (DP)
Graph Algorithms
Segment Trees
Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
For Product-Based Companies:
Revise important concepts (Step 1 topics)
System Design Basics (1-3 years experience)
OOPs (1-3 years experience)
Intermediate/Advanced System Design + Low-Level Design (LLD)/Machine Coding (4+ years experience)

How to Stay Consistent?
Key Message: If you are determined, you shouldnâ€™t be asking this.
Tips for Consistency
Create small goals (Daily/Weekly).
Don't set unrealistic goals.
Break down large topics into smaller sub-topics.
Example: Instead of completing "Stack" in 3 days, allocate 2 days to "Stack Implementation" and 2 days to "Monotonic Stack."
Celebrate small wins.
Dedicate specific time each day/week.
Track progress using:
GitHub
PDF Notes
LinkedIn or social media
Consistency is Key
Follow the above tips for 1-2 weeks, and it will become a habit.
Believe in yourself. Every expert was once a beginner.

Key Takeaways
Consistency is the key.
Start small but stay regular.
2025 is your year to shine.

Ending Note
Thank you and respect to all.
