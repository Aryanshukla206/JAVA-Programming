### **Motivational Quotes**
- "You have a whole new year to restart, refocus, reorganize, get back on track and correct the mistakes you did in 2024. It's a new opportunity. Don't waste it. ... It is never too late..."
- "Most people who doubt you; doubt you because they can never see themselves doing what you are trying to do."

   - 10 Hard (Prioritize famous interview questions).  

### Step 3: Identify Patterns in Problems
- Recognize patterns (e.g., Sliding Window for subarrays, DP for overlapping subproblems).  
- Apply techniques and revise as needed.  

### Step 4: Test with Contests
- Participate in contests after covering core topics.  
- Analyze mistakes, revise, and reattempt.

## **How to Stay Consistent?**
### Tips:
1. Create small goals (Daily/Weekly).  
2. Avoid unrealistic targets.  
3. Break large topics into manageable chunks.  
4. Track progress using:
   - GitHub  
   - Notes (PDF/Markdown)  
   - Social media for accountability.  

### Key Message:  
**"If you are determined, you shouldnâ€™t be asking this. Consistency is the key."**
